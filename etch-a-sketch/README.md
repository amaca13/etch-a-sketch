# The-Odin-Project-Etch-a-Sketch

To build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

What I learned
1. querySelector vs. getElementById
* They both select elements from a web page. They do so in different ways.
* querySelector method lets you retrieve an element using a CSS selector query, you can select elements by ID, class, or any other type of selector. 
* getElementById method retrieves an element by its DOM ID.
